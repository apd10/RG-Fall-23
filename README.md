## Roles in Fall 23 : 9th August 2023

We have the following roles in this edition.

### R1:
This is focused research presentations. You will have to declare a particular problem that you are looking at and make three presentations: 
1. The first presentation will be motivating the problem (signifiance, impact, urgency, etc) and some related work that people have done. (Example :  Embedding table compression is important, why, how have people solved this in the past, what problems remain, etc)
2. Fundamentals of the approach. This is a "teaching presentation" where you explain the fundamental toolkit that you are using. (Example: I am going to use random projection based approach. what are random projections, how to analyse their usefulness, what are hash functions, why they are important, analysing hash functions)
3. Your proposed method and results . (Example, the recipe to apply random projection based compression in embedding tables, results - quality, efficiency, etc)


### R2:
This is more general research presentations. You will pick an area of research (for example, training efficiency, model compression, ml on edge, etc). You ll be making 2 presentations. This is similar to how things ran in summer edition of reading group. 
You ll  keep reading papers on a single topic and summarize your learnings in two presentations. 

### R3:
This is a role of "moderating presentations". You ll not be presenting yourself. But you ll shadow readings of others if possible and actively discuss while they are presenting. The goal of this role is to keep the presentations engaging and to get the best out of it.

### R4: 
This is a role of "general audience and shadow". You ll read papers from one of the broad topics shadowing other presenters, listen in to presentations and participate in discussions.
